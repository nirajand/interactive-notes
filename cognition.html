                This influential theory proposes that intelligence is not a single, unitary construct but rather comprises distinct forms. Gardner identified several independent "intelligences," suggesting that individuals can excel in different areas regardless of their performance in others.
                <div class="info-box mt-2">

            <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Decision making is arguably one of the most critical applications of both thinking and intelligence. Every choice, from mundane daily selections to high-stakes strategic maneuvers, involves a complex interplay of cognitive processes, influenced by our inherent abilities and learned strategies.

                <span class="sub-heading !text-xl inline-block mb-2">How We Make Decisions (Daniel Kahneman's Systems of Thinking):</span>
                Our decisions are shaped by two primary cognitive systems:
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                    <li><span class="highlight-text">System 1 Thinking (Fast, Automatic, Intuitive):</span> This system operates quickly and automatically, relying on intuition, emotions, and mental shortcuts (heuristics). It's efficient for everyday decisions but prone to biases.
                        <div class="info-box mt-2">Example: Going with our gut feeling; using mental shortcuts (heuristics) like rule-of-thumb.</div>

            <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Creativity is not some mystical gift but a cognitive process deeply rooted in how we think and how intelligently we can apply our knowledge. It's the engine of innovation, artistic expression, and problem-solving through novel means.

                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                    <li>Can think of many ideas (high fluency in divergent thinking).</li>
                    <li>Can think in different ways (cognitive flexibility, embracing multiple perspectives).</li>
                    <li>Can make something original and useful (combining novelty with practicality).</li>
                    <li>Often possess curiosity, openness to experience, and a willingness to take risks.</li>

                    <li><span class="highlight-text">Preparation:</span> The initial stage of conscious work. It involves learning about the topic, gathering information, and intensely exploring the problem space. (E.g., researching a design challenge).</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight-text">Incubation:</span> A period of unconscious processing. The mind "rests" from direct effort, allowing ideas to churn subconsciously and new connections to form. (E.g., stepping away from the problem, sleeping on it).</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight-text">Illumination:</span> The "aha!" moment or insight. A sudden realization or breakthrough where a solution or novel idea spontaneously emerges into conscious awareness. (E.g., a lightbulb moment).</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight-text">Verification:</span> The final stage of conscious effort. It involves checking if the idea works, refining, testing, and elaborating on the solution to ensure its validity and practicality. (E.g., building a prototype, writing the final draft).</li>

                    <li><span class="highlight-text">Divergent Thinking:</span> Essential for generating a wide array of potential solutions or ideas, especially during the preparation and incubation phases.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight-text">Associative Thinking:</span> Key to making unique connections between seemingly unrelated concepts, often leading to the "illumination" breakthrough.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight-text">Convergent Thinking:</span> Important in the later stages (verification) to refine, evaluate, and select the most promising ideas, ensuring they are appropriate and workable.</li>

                    <li><span class="highlight-text">Working Memory & Executive Function:</span> Supports the manipulation and combination of multiple ideas simultaneously, crucial for complex creative tasks.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight-text">Threshold Theory:</span> This theory suggests that a certain minimum level of intelligence is necessary for creativity. However, beyond that threshold (e.g., an IQ of around 120), higher IQ scores don't necessarily correlate with higher levels of creativity. Other factors like personality traits (openness to experience, risk-taking), motivation, and environment become more critical.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                <span class="sub-heading !text-xl inline-block mb-2">Metacognition in Creativity:</span>
                Thinking about one's own thinking process allows individuals to optimize their creative approaches, identify and overcome mental blocks, and strategically switch between divergent and convergent thinking modes.
